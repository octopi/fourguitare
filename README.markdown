===========

If you squint, the grid system of Manhattan looks a little like a guitar. This little hack takes this notion and runs with itâ€”it takes a section of midtown and turns it into an actual instrument. The guitar "strings" run from 8th Ave. to Park, and the frets go from 56th St. to 34th St. The notes being played are currently what's trending on foursquare in midtown, and the sounds themselves are generated by the W3C's emerging Web Audio API. It gets quite whimsical at times.

This was created by me for the hackNY Fall 2011 Hackathon! It got quite whimsical at times.
